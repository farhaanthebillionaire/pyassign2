# Assignment 2 â€“ Module 3: Control Structures in Python

This repository contains two Python programs demonstrating basic control structures using `if-else` and `for` loops.

---

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
- Takes an integer input from the user.
- Checks if it's even or odd using an if-else condition.
- Displays the result.

**File**: `task1.py`

---

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
- Uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 50.
- Calculates the sum of all numbers in this range.
- Prints the final result.

**File**: `task2.py`

---

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then run each file like this:

```bash
python task1.py
python task2.py
